# Project 6 -- School's Out

You are inside a nightmare where you have to play dodgeball against clones of your evil principal.

## How to play
To throw a ball, you click and hold the mouse in the direction that you want to throw.
The longer you click and hold, the more powerful your throw will be.
The objective is to hit the enemies as much as you can before time runs out.
If the enemies hit you more times than you hit the enemies, you lose.
